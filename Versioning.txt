Why  am I explaining?

Two purposes
a) Most of the custom visuals code is in Github, to download and understand this knowledge is required.
b) To know  about versioning processing process



Git Hub : Documents controlling cum versioning component




Versioning

Maintaining multiple copies of the same document with multiple changes is called as versioning.
In real time all organizations implement this as part of documents storing and keep tracking of changes.

Microsoft applications frequently used versioning tools

a) TFS [Team Foundation Server]
b) Git Hub
c) VSS [Visual Source Safe]
e) SVN [Sub Version] etc.

etc...


GitHub
======
Source code build, control and version maintenance service.

Step 1:

Here we create a repository and all documents store under repository master branch.
Versioning maintained in that branch only.

Step 2:

In case any doc change required, create a child branch, take documents, download them.
Work on  the documents, place in the child branch.

Step 3:

Later merge the child branch documents with parent branch [master].

Step 4:

Remove the child branch after operations.

Step 5:

Now the master havig multiple versions for the documents in the repository.

Your Github work
--------------------

1. Create a Github account
2. Create a repository, upload files to Master Branch
3. Create a child branch, download child branch data, modify the files
4. Pull, Compare & Merge to Master Branch
5. Delete Child Branch
6. Master branch--> docs--> History--> Monitor the history
